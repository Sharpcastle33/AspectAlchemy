# AspectAlchemy

Aspect Alchemy is a complete potion crafting overhaul for Minecraft servers running Spigot 1.12, built for CivEx: First Light.

Aspect Alchemy fundamentally changes the way players create potions by introducing an Aspect system. Server administrators can designate items as containing aspect, including custom items.

Instead of simply using one ingredient to brew a potion, Aspect Alchemy allows administrators to create potion recipes that require a certain amount of aspects. With this system, there are thousands of possible item combinations that will create a valid potion. Players can use any combination of items to brew a potion, as long as their input matches the recipe's target aspect amounts, and enough Shaman Sap is provided to soak up the energies of the excess materials.

Players can construct Alembics, which hold up to 15 ingredients for potion crafting.

With Aspect Alchemy, players can refine their recipes by searching for cheaper or less time consuming ingredient combinations, and trying them out for themselves.

Aspect Alchemy supports any number of custom potion recipes using a YAML style formatting system. Server Administrators can designate their own recipes by editing the default YAML configs. Since recipes and aspect values on CivEx are meant to be discovered by players experimenting with the system, we don't have our own configs posted online. Instead, you can use the sample configs posted at https://github.com/CivilizatonExperiment/CivEx--First-Light-Configs/tree/master/Alchemy
